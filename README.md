## Objective and steps

#### a) Select structure-candidates.

   * Select 25 P1 structures from PDB and prepare them for quantum refinement.
   
#### b) Run cheap HF energy and gradients calculation using clustering.

   * pick up results from "a)" and  use it as input to run cheap HF calculation  using clustering.
   
   * write only gradient-based LBFGS (the line-search version)   

#### c) Final HF based refinement.

   * Analyse results of "b)" and pick one or two most favorable (showing most improvement)
   to run HF based refinements.

Details for each step a-b-c) follow below.

Structure preparation
---------------------

#### 1) Get structures from PDB. 

   * This is done manually using RCSB site. Selection criteria are: P1, not too many atoms, 
   resolution ~3-4 Ã…, bad validation metrics. The criteria are rather arbitrary: we try
   to find low-resolution models that we believe can be improved by quantum refinement.

   * File were downloaded using 
   phenix.fetch_pdb PDB_CODE --mtz

   * Some models have unknown to Phenix ligands. Corresponding CIF files were 
created using 
  phenix.ready_set file_name.pdb
This also adds hydrogens with are needed for the run_finalise.py script. The
output is file_name.updated.pdb which needs to be renamed? We can use 
phenix.reduce which has it's own problems.

   * Some data file were missing R-free flags. They were added at subsequent (re-refinement).

   * .pdb, .mtz and .cif files are stored in 00 folder.

#### 2) Phenix-Refine 

   * Refine structures from "1)" using phenix.refine. List of commands per each structure is
   in 01_run_phenix_refine file.

   * Refinement results are stored in 01 folder. MTZ files from this folder are to be used in all
   subsequent refinements.

#### 3) Finalize

   * Run structure from "2)" through 02_run_update_pdb.py using command
   phenix.ready_set is used to add hydrogens to amino acids and ligands
   run_finalise.py is used to complete structures, remove altlocs and resset occupancies
   all completed structrues by 02_run_update_pdb.py are in 02

   XXX This needs a careful and clear description what's being done and how. Adding H and missing
   non-H atoms? Remove altlocs? Reset occupancies? XXX

   All PDBs in folder 01 have no errors in running 02_run_update_pdb.py are listed in folder 02.  
   9  out of 25 structures in folder 01 pass 02_run_update_pdb.py successfully. 


Current issues to be resolved ASAP:

  * Errors that have been postponed or manually resolved:
    * 1u0d - multiple models
    * 2jee - has a terminal amino acid with just a N

  * Known errors:
    * 1il5 - tardy errors
    * 3kyi - nonstandard amino acid has strange charge
    * 4k2r - ANP does not have partial charges
    * 4rnf - bug in cctbx geometry restraints
    * 5d12 - G97
    * 3oe9 - ITD
    * 3uds - ADP
    * 4ctd - C8E

  * Unknown errors:
    * 2x10 - tardy errors, maximum charge error
    * 3nak - strange nonstandard amino acid

  * No errors:
    * 1va7 - :heavy_check_mark:
    * 1y1l - :heavy_check_mark:
    * 1ok9 - :heavy_check_mark: ACT, GOL added to GeoStd
    * 2oeq - :heavy_check_mark:
    * 2oy0 - :heavy_check_mark:
    * 2ghj - :heavy_check_mark:
    * 3tz9 - :heavy_check_mark: AQU added to GeoStd
    * 3dtj - :heavy_check_mark:
    * 3uj4 - :heavy_check_mark:
    * 4xa1 - :heavy_check_mark:
    * 4drw - :heavy_check_mark:
    * 4fsx - :heavy_check_mark:
    * 4rnf - :heavy_check_mark:
    * 4p7h - :heavy_check_mark:
    * 5diz - :heavy_check_mark: Has S-S bond, better check them.

  * Waters
    * Do we make a policy about the inclusion of water below a certain resolution? 

  * Program completeness
    * need complete list of D-peptides
    * need complete list of nonstandard peptides

Testing
-------

Testing is very simple. Run tests/run_tests.py and check for Sorry's.

  * Tests to add:
    * Carbohydrates are correctly charged - taken from Chemical Components but
      polymerisation is not checked
    * Test that a ligand has partial charges

Structure refinement
